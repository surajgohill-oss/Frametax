canonical_production_view.py

The view adapter behind the RESTORED mature CineGlobe production UI
(Overview/Workspace/Scenarios/ProjectGlobe/Reports/Knowledge — the rich
pre-regression component tree, /projects/{id}/overview etc.), generalized
to any project_id.

Reshapes ProductionStructure / StructureCalculationResult — the SAME
canonical-1.1.0 persisted rows canonical_evaluation.py commits, already
proven to reproduce Little Utopia's exact accepted NPC ($3,057,794.90) —
into the `production` / `structures.allocated_structures` shape those
mature components already read (built against
`app/demo/little_utopia_state.py::build_allocated_structures` /
`get_production`). Computes NO economics; every number here is read
straight off an already-committed StructureCalculationResult row.

Fields the persisted engine does not compute generically yet (per-account
allocation assignments, conditional funding programs, structure
compatibility, a written recommendation) are served as honest empty
values (`[]` / `{}` / `null`), never fabricated — the same "if data is
absent, show the appropriate empty state" principle already established
for the Script/Documents tabs in project_workspace_view.py. This is a
disclosed, structural gap (deep per-segment drill-downs render fewer
details generically than Little Utopia's own richer, unchanged
/api/v1/cineglobe/production|structures endpoints), not a defect.
