program_rate_rules.py

Statutory incentive-RATE rules per program, with the PERMANENT
rate-authority doctrine of this application:

  RULE 1 — Budget documents are never authoritative for incentive rates
           or statutory rules.
  RULE 2 — Any incentive percentage appearing in an uploaded budget or
           financial model is IGNORED for calculation purposes. It may
           be recorded (as data) solely so Rule 5 can report the
           conflict.
  RULE 3 — Incentive rates come only from this module (the incentive
           database's static mirror) and the statutory/guidance
           authority cited on each rule row.
  RULE 4 — Cross-border optimization compares jurisdictions using
           database/statutory rates only (jurisdiction_comparison
           profiles must mirror this module for any program it covers).
  RULE 5 — When the database and a production budget disagree, the
           database rate is used and the conflict is reported, never
           silently swallowed.

The same static-mirror discipline as program_spend_rules.py: nothing
here is invented — every rate, threshold, and condition carries the
verbatim quoted language and document it came from.
