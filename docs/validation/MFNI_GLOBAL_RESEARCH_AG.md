# MFNI GLOBAL RESEARCH REPORT — AG DISCOVERY

## 1. REPOSITORY IDENTIFICATION
- **Absolute working path:** `/Users/Suraj/cineglobe-frametax`
- **Git remote:** `origin https://github.com/surajgohill-oss/Frametax.git`
- **Branch:** `claude/audit-frametax-features-NZcX5`
- **HEAD SHA:** `0f3898b19366d2b8f217b1daca8c3d7200a9294a`
- **Canonical Status:** Confirmed operating in canonical repository.

## 2. EXISTING MFNI ARCHITECTURE DISCOVERED
I inspected the application code, specifically `frametax2/backend/app/data/location_cost_benchmarks.py`.
The current MFNI architecture is a static dictionary of `JurisdictionCostProfile` dataclasses. It maps jurisdiction `iso2` codes to fixed numerical multipliers, cost indices (relative to LA = 1.0), and USD dollar amounts. There are regional fallbacks configured. It does NOT use a single macroeconomic multiplier, adhering to CineGlobe principles.

## 3. EXISTING MFNI TAXONOMY
The implemented taxonomy contains the following cost drivers:
- **Travel/Airfare:** `airfare_lax_business_usd`, `airfare_lax_economy_usd`, `airfare_jfk_delta_usd`
- **Accommodation:** `hotel_rate_usd`, `apartment_monthly_usd`
- **Per Diem:** `per_diem_atl_usd`, `per_diem_btl_usd`
- **Labor / Crew:** `crew_rate_index`
- **Equipment:** `equipment_rental_index`
- **Stages / Facilities:** `stage_facility_index`
- **Post Production / VFX:** `post_production_index`, `vfx_index`
- **Permits / Visas:** `work_permit_cost_usd`, `visa_cost_usd`
- **Local Transport:** `local_transport_daily_usd`
- **Logistics / Cargo:** `freight_carnet_pct`
- **Payroll / Fringes:** `payroll_fringe_pct`, `payroll_overhead_pct`
- **Professional Services:** `legal_accounting_index`
- **Local vs Imported Crew:** `local_hire_min_pct`
- **Unit / Catering:** `catering_daily_usd`
- **Risk Multipliers:** `fx_risk_pct`, `contingency_adj_pct`, `schedule_risk_multiplier`

*Delta Additions Required by Prompt:* Workday/OT rules, Statutory/Contractual Fringes breakdown, Stage rental pricing/capacity, Location/permit fees, Art/Construction materials.

## 4. EXISTING BENCHMARK INVENTORY & PROVENANCE
- **Current Coverage:** 44 National Jurisdictions.
- **Provenance / Sources:** The `data_sources` field exists in the dataclass but is **empty** for all 44 records.
- **Currentness:** There are no `effective_date` stamps. All 44 records are **DATE UNKNOWN** and **SOURCE MISSING**.
- **Confidence:** Assigned broadly as "HIGH", "MEDIUM", or "LOW" but lacking primary commercial or statutory verification (heuristics detected).

## 6. JURISDICTION × CATEGORY RESEARCH: GB (UNITED KINGDOM)

### Labor / Workday Research
- **Local Crew Labor:** RESEARCHED (Partial)
- **Workday / OT Structure:** RESEARCHED (Partial)
- **Findings:** Pact/Bectu TV Drama Agreement updated Jan 1, 2024, separates productions into 4 budget bands (e.g., Band 1 up to £1.25M, Band 4 over £8M). Rate cards are recommended by BECTU branches (Camera, Art, Costume), not set industry-wide by Pact.
- **Source:** BECTU Official Website, Pact Agreements (Tier 1/Tier 3)
- **Confidence:** STRONG for structure, PROVISIONAL for exact scale (depends on branch).

### Fringes / Payroll
- **Employer National Insurance (NI):** RESEARCHED. 13.8% for 2024-2025 on earnings above £9,100/yr. (Increases to 15% and £5,000 threshold in April 2025). No special film exemption for Employer NI.
- **Workplace Pension:** RESEARCHED. Statutory minimum employer contribution is 3% of qualifying earnings (total 8%).
- **Holiday Pay:** RESEARCHED. PACT advises 10.77%; BECTU advises 12.07%. BECTU strongly pushing for 12.07% for freelancers under the April 2024 "irregular hours" legislation.
- **Source:** UK Gov (HMRC), PACT/BECTU statements (Tier 1/Tier 3)
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED (Statutory rates) / STRONG (Union guidance).

### Stages / Facilities
- **Stage Rental Pricing:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Major UK studios (Pinewood, Shepperton, Warner Bros Leavesden) do NOT publish public rate cards. Pricing is confidential, case-by-case, and highly dependent on scale, duration, and bundled services (offices, workshops).
- **Source:** Pinewood Studios, Commercial research (Tier 2/Tier 3)
- **Confidence:** BLOCKED (Rate not publicly disclosed for Tier 1 facilities; secondary commercial sources required for modeling).

### Equipment
- **Rental Pricing:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Top-tier rental houses (ARRI Rental UK, Procam Take 2) operate purely on a quote-by-request basis for film drama packages. No standardized public rate card is available for 2024. Volume discounts and project duration heavily dictate the actual rate.
- **Source:** ARRI Rental UK, Procam Take 2 (Tier 2)
- **Confidence:** BLOCKED (Rate not publicly disclosed for Tier 1 vendors; secondary/independent price lists may be needed as proxies).

### Locations / Permits
- **Location/Permit Fees:** RESEARCHED. 
- **Findings:** Decentralized across 33 London local authorities. No single rate card. Each borough sets its own fee structure via FilmApp. Temporary Traffic Orders (Road Closures) generally cost £1,000 – £2,000 and require 6-8 weeks minimum notice.
- **Source:** Film London, Borough Film Services (Tier 1/Tier 3).
- **Confidence:** STRONG (Structural understanding), PROVISIONAL (for exact deterministic pricing as it is highly localized).

### Travel / Accommodation
- **Per Diems:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** No industry-wide BECTU per diem agreement. Most productions default to HMRC tax-free benchmark scale rates (up to £25/day for 24-hour periods). Amounts beyond this attract NI/tax unless bespoke arrangements are agreed with HMRC.
- **Source:** UK Gov (HMRC Employment Income Manual) (Tier 1).
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED (Tax threshold) / STRONG (Industry convention).

### Catering / Unit Services
- **Catering Pricing:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Industry standard daily rate typically falls between £18 and £35 per head (excluding VAT), with £25/head as a safe baseline for drama/commercial. Breakfast usually adds £6–£10/head.
- **Source:** UK location catering commercial vendors (e.g. Reel Menus) (Tier 2).
- **Confidence:** STRONG (Primary commercial quotes).

### Post Production / VFX
- **VFX Incentive Economics:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Effective Jan 1, 2025, the UK Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit (AVEC) provides an enhanced 39% rate for VFX (net 29.25%). The 80% cap on qualifying expenditure is removed specifically for VFX.
- **Source:** HMRC, BFI (Tier 1).
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED.

### Local vs Imported Crew
- **Imported Labor Tax/Withholding:** RESEARCHED. 
- **Findings:** The UK operates a specific Foreign Entertainers Unit (FEU). Payments to non-UK resident performers/cast (even via loan-out companies) require a strict 20% withholding tax, which must be modeled. However, this 20% FEU withholding does NOT apply to imported technical crew (e.g., directors, camera operators) who may fall under standard dual-taxation or temporary worker rules depending on time spent. 
- **Source:** HMRC Foreign Entertainers Unit (Tier 1).
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED.

### Construction / Materials
- **Materials Pricing:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** No film-specific rate cards exist for raw construction materials (timber, steel, paint). Filming in the UK requires tracking general regional construction material price indices (Opex / BCIS).
- **Source:** Commercial Construction Indices.
- **Confidence:** PROVISIONAL (Requires dynamic macro-economic linkage rather than a static film benchmark).

### Equipment
- **Rental Pricing:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Similar to the UK, tier 1 camera/grip vendors (Panavision, ARRI, Keslow) do not publish static rate cards. Pricing is heavily quote-based, depending on duration and volume.
- **Source:** Major rental houses (Tier 2).
- **Confidence:** BLOCKED (Requires deterministic input from actual production quotes).

### Travel / Accommodation
- **Per Diems (Distant Location):** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Union CBAs dictate the absolute floor for "distant location" per diems. For 2024, SAG-AFTRA requires ~$75/day ($16B/$22L/$37D). IATSE requires $70/day (scaling to $75/day in 2026). DGA aligns with union standards ("first class" requirement). GSA rates are utilized primarily to cap tax-free accountability, not as a replacement for the union minimum floor.
- **Source:** SAG-AFTRA, IATSE Basic Agreement, GSA (Tier 1).
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED.

### Locations / Permits (CA, NY, GA)
- **Permit Fees:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** 
  - **Los Angeles (FilmLA):** $931 standard application fee (up to 5 locations/7 days); $350 for low-impact shoots.
  - **New York (NYC MOME):** $500 application fee covering a 14-day period.
  - **Georgia:** Highly decentralized. Atlanta charges ~$100 app fee + $300/mo. Savannah charges $325/location. 
- **Source:** FilmLA, NYC MOME, Georgia Local Film Offices (Tier 1).
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED.

### Catering / Unit Services
- **Catering Pricing:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** Ranges from $30 to $65 per person per day for standard hot meals (breakfast/lunch). Craft services alone average $15-$20/day. LA trends toward the higher end, while Atlanta offers more competitive bundled rates.
- **Source:** Commercial production catering quotes (Tier 2).
- **Confidence:** STRONG (Market range).

### Post Production / VFX
- **Incentive Economics:** RESEARCHED.
- **Findings:** The US framework is highly disjointed. 
  - **California:** Introduces a standalone 35%-50% post-production credit (Sept 2026) and a 5% VFX uplift on general incentives, but programs are capped.
  - **New York:** Dedicated fully refundable 30% credit for post-production (plus 5% upstate uplift).
  - **Georgia:** Transferable 20% base credit for post-production (plus uplifts), notably with NO annual cap.
- **Source:** CA Film Commission, NY State Governor's Office of Motion Picture & Television Development, Georgia Dept of Economic Development (Tier 1).
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED.

### Gaps / Incomplete (Next Execution Needed)
- US Construction / Materials (requires broad CPI indices tracking)
- US Local vs Imported Crew taxation nuances (Loan-outs across state lines)
